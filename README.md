<details>
<summary>
Validate your environment setup
</summary>

1. Check that environment uses Python 3.12

```bash
uv run python -V
```

2. Check that `flash-attn` is installed

```bash
uv run python -c "import flash_attn"
```

3. Check that you can run training debug mode 

```bash
uv run train @ configs/training/debug.toml
```

4. Check that you can run the orchestrator against an inference server

```bash
uv run infer @ configs/inference/debug.toml
```
```bash
uv run orchestrator @ configs/training/orchestrator/debug.toml
```
</details>


## Entrypoints

### RL

**Reverse Text**

Train a tiny model (`willcb/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Reverse-SFT`) to learn to reverse a small chunk of text. Training is extremely quick because we allow a maximum context of 128 tokens. With two small GPUs (e.g. RTX 3090/ 4090), this experiment should finish in less than 5 minutes.

First, start the inference server

```bash
uv run infer @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml
```

Then, start the trainer which will spawn the orchestrator as a subprocess

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 uv run train @ configs/training/reverse_text.toml
```

**Simple Math**

Train a small model (`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B`) on high-school level math questions. It is recommended to have at least 2xA100-80GB GPUs or more for this experiment.

First, start the inference server

```bash
uv run infer @ configs/inference/simple_math.toml --parallel.dp 1
```

Then, start the trainer which will spawn the orchestrator as a subprocess

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 uv run train @ configs/training/simple_math.toml
```

*NB: If you have more than 2 GPUs available, the best way to speed up the run is to increase the DP size of the inference worker, i.e. adjusting the `--parallel.dp` argument.*

## Contributing

*For now, development is only possible on CUDA-enabled devices. However, we build production-ready images for both CUDA (NVIDIA) and ROCM (AMD) GPUs that should work out of the box.*

### Setup

1. Optionally, install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Config System

We use `pydantic-settings` to configure `prime-rl`. To get an overview of the available configurations, run the following command:

```bash
uv run python src/zeroband/training/train.py --help
```

```bash
uv run python src/zeroband/inference/server.py --help
```

**Sources**

We support the following sources for configuration, in this order of precedence:

1. **Command-line arguments**: You can pass (nested) arguments as `--key.subkey value` to the script. For example, to set the model name you can run `--model.name`

2. **Config files**: You can pass `.toml` config files (defined in the `configs` directory) using the `@` prefix. For example, to use the `debug.toml` config file, you can run `uv run python src/zeroband/inference/server.py @ configs/inference/debug.toml`. (*If you leave a space between the `@` and the config file, you will get shell path auto-completions.*)

3. **Environment variables**: You can set environment variables to override the config values. All environment variables must be prefixed with `PRIME_` and use the `__` delimiter to nest the keys. For example, to set the model name you can run `export PRIME_MODEL__NAME=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`.

4. **Defaults**: For almost all config arguments, we have a default value which will be used if no other source is provided.

In general we recommend setting configurations via config files to define reproducible experiments and use command-line arguments to override the config values to run variants of the same experiment. Environment variables are usually only used in production settings to communicate with the [Prime Protocol](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/protocol) worker. In most cases, you should not need to use environment variables.

The precendence order will be important if multiple sources try to configure the same argument. For example, in the following command, all sources will define a model name

```toml
# qwen8b.toml
[model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"
```

```toml
# qwen14b.toml
[model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen-14B"
```

```bash
PRIME_MODEL__NAME=Qwen/Qwen3-4B uv run src/zeroband/inference/server.py @qwen8b.toml @qwen14b.toml --model.name Qwen/Qwen3-32B
```

In this example, the CLI argument `--model.name Qwen/Qwen3-32B` will take precendence and the script will use `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` as the model name. If the CLI argument wasn't set, then the second config file would take precedence and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen-14B` as the model name. If the second config file wasn't set, then the first config file would take precedence and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` as the model name. Finally, if the first config file wasn't set, then the environment variable would take precedence and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen-4B` as the model name. If the environment variable wasn't set, then the default value would be used and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` as the model name.

### Tests

Run the full test suite 

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

To run unit tests, run

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit -v
```

To run integration tests, run

```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration -v
```

To run CPU-only tests, use the inverse of the `gpu` marker:

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "not gpu"
```

To run fast tests, use the inverse of the `slow` marker:

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "not slow"
```

### Checkpoint, rollout, step numbering and async level
At each step `n`, all artifacts (e.g., checkpoint, rollout, gradient) are tagged with the same step number.
- Step 0:
  - Uses checkpoint 0 on rollout 0 to compute gradient 0.
  - Then computes checkpoint 1 as: `ckpt 1 = ckpt 0 - grad 0`

In general, the model used for generating rollouts at step `n` is from `ckpt[n - async_level]`.

- When async_level = 0, the rollout and gradient are based on the same model version.
  This is equivalent to synchronous on-policy training.
