## Installation

> *`prime-rl` is developed and tested on NVIDIA A100, H100, H200, and B200; likely compatible with other Ampere, Hopper and Blackwell-class GPUs. If your installation fails, please create an [issue](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/issues).*

**Quick Installation (Recommended)**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
<summary>
Manual Installation
</summary>

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl.git
cd prime-rl
```

2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

3. Synchronize the environment

```bash
uv sync && uv sync --all-extras
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>
Validate your environment setup
</summary>

1. Check that environment uses Python 3.12

```bash
uv run python -V
```

2. Check that `flash-attn` is installed

```bash
uv run python -c "import flash_attn"
```

3. Check that you can run training debug mode (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run trainer @ configs/trainer/debug.toml
```

4. Check that you can run the orchestrator against an inference server (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run inference @ configs/inference/debug.toml
```

```bash
uv run orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/debug.toml
```

5. Check that you can run a toy RL run (*this requires 2 GPUs and lasts 5min, see more below*)

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml \
  --inference @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml
```

</details>


## Additional Setup

1. If you want to log your runs to W&B (`wandb`), log in

```bash
uv run wandb login
# Or set `export WANDB_API_KEY=...`
```

2. If you require gated/ private models or datasets from HuggingFace, log in

```bash
uv run huggingface-cli login
# Or set `export HF_TOKEN=...`
```

3. You may want to increase the number of open files to prevent errors like `Too many open files`.

```bash
ulimit -n 32000
```

4.  We provide a convenient tmux layout script to start a run and view logs. To start the session simply run

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh
```

Then, paste the experiment entrypoints detailed below in the `Trainer` pane to start your run!

## RL

### Single Node Training

We provide a convenience endpoint `rl` for single-node RL experiments. It configures and starts the trainer, orchestrator and, optionally, an inference server. It enforces correctly setting shared configs (e.g. the model name or async level should be the same across all modules) and dispatches and monitors subprocesses. To stream the logs from each module we use file logging. By default, only the trainer logs will be displayed on the main process (*use the tmux layout script to conveniently view all logs*).

To check all available configuration options, run `uv run rl --help`.

**Reverse Text**

Train a tiny model (`willcb/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Reverse-SFT`) to learn to reverse a small chunk of text. Training is extremely quick because we allow a maximum context of 128 tokens. 

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml \
  --inference @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml
```

*With two small GPUs (e.g. RTX 3090/ 4090), this experiment should finish in less than 5 minutes.*

**Hendrycks Math**

Train a small model (`willcb/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B`) on high-school level math questions. It is recommended to have at least 2xA100-80GB GPUs or more for this experiment.

On eight GPUs, run the following command to run the experiment.

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/hendrycks_math/1b.toml \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/hendrycks_math/1b.toml \
  --inference @ configs/inference/hendrycks_math/1b.toml \
  --trainer-gpus 2 --inference-gpus 6
```

*NB: This setup requires 8 GPUs - 2 are used for the FSDP trainer, 6 are used for inference.*

**INTELLECT-2 Math**

Train a small model (`willcb/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B`) on complex math questions from the INTELLECT-2 dataset.

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/intellect_math/1b.toml \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/intellect_math/1b.toml \
  --inference @ configs/inference/intellect_math/1b.toml \
  --trainer-gpus 2 --inference-gpus 6
```

*NB: This setup requires 8 GPUs - 2 are used for the FSDP trainer, 6 are used for inference.*

### Multi-Node Training

*TBD*

### Multiple Experiments per Node

For small models/ quick ablations, it can be more efficient to parallelize experiments within a node (e.g. split your GPUs to run two experiments in parallel). Because the trainer communicates with the orchestrator via a shared file system, and the orchestrator communicates with the inference engine via an OAI-compatible API, the connection points have to be uniquely set. For example, if you have access to 4 GPUs you can run two 2 GPU training runs in parallel as follows:

Start the first experiment as normal, but specify a unique experiment identifier (*will use the first 2 GPUs*)

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh exp-1
```

```bash
# Start the first experiment
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml \
  --inference @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml \
  --exp-id exp-1
```

For the second experiment, configure a new server port for the inference engine and orchestrator and choose a new experiment identifier (*will use the first 2 GPUs*)

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh exp-2
```

```bash
# Start the second experiment
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3,4 uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml \
  --inference @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml \
  --inference.server.port 8001 \
  --orchestrator.client.port 8001 \
  --exp-id exp-2
```

## Evals

We provide a convenience endpoint for running a full evaluation suite of common benchmarks such as AIME, MATH-500 or LiveCodeBench against your model using the `eval` entrypoint.

```bash
uv run inference --model.name Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --max-model-len 2048
```

```bash
uv run eval --model.name Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --benchmarks math500,aime24,aime25
```

To check all available configuration options, run `uv run eval --help`.


## Developer

*For now, development is only possible on CUDA-enabled devices.*

### Setup

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Configs

**Sources**

We support the following sources for configuration, in this order of precedence:

1. **Command-line arguments**: You can pass (nested) arguments as `--key.subkey value` to the script. For example, to set the model name you can run `--model.name`

2. **Config files**: You can pass `.toml` config files (defined in the `configs` directory) using the `@` prefix. For example, to use the `debug.toml` config file, you can run `uv run inference @ configs/inference/debug.toml`. (*If you leave a space between the `@` and the config file, you will get shell path auto-completions.*)

3. **Environment variables**: You can set environment variables to override the config values. All environment variables must be prefixed with `PRIME_` and use the `__` delimiter to nest the keys. For example, to set the model name you can run `export PRIME_MODEL__NAME=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`.

4. **Defaults**: For almost all config arguments, we have a default value which will be used if no other source is provided.

In general we recommend setting configurations via config files to define reproducible experiments and use command-line arguments to override the config values to run variants of the same experiment. Environment variables are usually only used in production settings to communicate with the [Prime Protocol](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/protocol) worker. In most cases, you should not need to use environment variables.

The precendence order will be important if multiple sources try to configure the same argument. For example, in the following command, all sources will define a model name

```toml
# qwen8b.toml
[model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"
```

```toml
# qwen14b.toml
[model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen-14B"
```

```bash
PRIME_MODEL__NAME=Qwen/Qwen3-4B uv run inference @qwen8b.toml @qwen14b.toml --model.name Qwen/Qwen3-32B
```

In this example, the CLI argument `--model.name Qwen/Qwen3-32B` will take precendence and the script will use `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` as the model name. If the CLI argument wasn't set, then the second config file would take precedence and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen-14B` as the model name. If the second config file wasn't set, then the first config file would take precedence and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` as the model name. Finally, if the first config file wasn't set, then the environment variable would take precedence and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen-4B` as the model name. If the environment variable wasn't set, then the default value would be used and the script would use `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` as the model name.

### Persistent Inference Server

For development purposes it is useful start the inference server once and keep it alive across experiments to avoid suffering the vLLM startup time repeatedly. The recommended workflow is as follows:

1. Start the pre-layouted tmux session using the tmux script

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh
```

2. Start the inference server in the `Inference` pane.

```bash
uv run inference @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml
```

3. Start the trainer and orchestrator in the `Trainer` pane.

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml
```

To kill the tmux session when you're done:

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh kill
```

### Checkpointing

Our codebase supports checkpointing. Because of the trainer/ orchestrator design, as well as the natural asynchrony checkpointing is non-standard.

- Trainer (`src/prime_rl/trainer/ckpt.py`): Checkpoints FSDP model shard, optimizer state and progress (training step, total samples, total tokens)
- Orchestrator (`src/prime_rl/trainer/ckpt.py`): Checkpoints orchestrator progress

*NB: Each run with asynchrony level `async_level` and some checkpoint step `x`, requires weight checkpoints in the step range `[x-async_level, x]`. Currently we do not duplicate weight checkpoints into the `checkpoints` directory but simply keep them around in `weights`, by keeping the trainer from cleaning up weight checkpoints that are required for resuming training. This way, the orchestrator only needs to checkpoint its progress (read: step) to load the correct weights into the inference engine upon resuming.*

The default checkpoint directory is `checkpoints` and each checkpoint step will live in a subdirectory enumerated by the step, i.e. `checkpoints/step_{step}`. The trainer checkpoint is called `trainer.pt` for single GPU workloads, else `trainer_{local_rank}.pt`. The orchestrator checkpoint is callec `orchestrator.pt`. Thus, this is a typical directory structure:

```bash
checkpoints
├── step_10
│   ├── orchestrator.pt
│   └── trainer.pt
├── step_25
│   ├── orchestrator.pt
│   └── trainer.pt
└── step_30
    ├── orchestrator.pt
    └── trainer.pt
```

Checkpointing is configured by the `CheckpointConfig`, with the config key `--ckpt`. One can specify:
- `--ckpt.path` to change the checkpoint directory (default: `checkpoints`)
- `--ckpt.interval` to change the interval frequency (default: `50`)
- `--ckpt.save-async` to save the checkpoint asynchronously (default: `False`)

By default, runs do no write checkpoints to save disk space. To checkpoint every 10 steps on our debug RL run, run the following command

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 uv run trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml --ckpt.interval 10 
```

To resume a run use the `--ckpt.resume-step` flag. To resume from the checkpoint step 10 from the previous command, run the following command

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 uv run trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml --ckpt.resume_step 10
```

Because we save progress information, resuming from a checkpoint is fully W&B compatible. By default, resuming from a checkpoint, will simply create a new run. To resume the same W&B run, you'd have to pass the same W&B run ID for both the trainer and the orchestrator, e.g.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 uv run trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml \
  --monitor.wandb.project <project> \
  --ckpt.resume-step 10 \
  --monitor.wandb.id <trainer-run-id> \
```

You also need to restart the orchestrator from a checkpoint, the api is the same as the trainer, e.g.

```bash
uv run orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml \
  --monitor.wandb.project <project> \
  --ckpt.resume-step 10 \
  --monitor.wandb.id <orchestrator-run-id>
```

If you started your run using the rl.py script, you can resume the same run by passing the same W&B run ID for both the trainer and the orchestrator, e.g.

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml \
  --trainer.monitor.wandb.id <trainer-run-id> \
  --trainer.ckpt.resume-step 10 \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml \
  --orchestrator.ckpt.resume-step 10 \
  --orchestrator.monitor.wandb.id <orchestrator-run-id> 
```

You don't need to restart the inference server if started manually, the orchestrator will automatically send the right checkpoint to the inference server when resuming.

### Benchmarking

We provide a convenient way to benchmark the performance of the inference engine and trainer using the `--bench` flag. It will run each module in isolation for a few steps and log performance statistics to the console and, optionally, W&B.

**Inference**

To benchmark inference, first spin up the inference server with an experiment configuration

```bash
uv run inference @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml
```

Then, start the orchestrator with the matching configuration file in benchmark mode

```bash
uv run orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml --bench
```

**Trainer**

To benchmark the trainer, simply run the trainer against a fake data loader matching the way the orchestrator would write the training batch.

```bash
uv run trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml --bench --data.fake "{'micro_batch_size': 8, 'batch_size': 128, 'seq_len': 128}"
```

**RL**

Often it will be most convenient to benchmark the full RL run. This will automatically set the training batch configuration to match the way the orchestrator would have written it.

```bash
uv run rl   \
  --trainer @ configs/trainer/reverse_text.toml  \
  --orchestrator @ configs/orchestrator/reverse_text.toml \
  --inference @ configs/inference/reverse_text.toml
```

### Tests

Run the full test suite 

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

To run unit tests, run

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit -v
```

To run integration tests, run

```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration -v
```

To run CPU-only tests, use the inverse of the `gpu` marker:

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "not gpu"
```

To run fast tests, use the inverse of the `slow` marker:

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "not slow"
```

### Step Definition

At each step `n`, all artifacts (e.g., checkpoint, rollout, gradient) are tagged with the same step number.
- Step 0:
  - Uses checkpoint 0 on rollout 0 to compute gradient 0.
  - Then computes checkpoint 1 as: `ckpt 1 = ckpt 0 - grad 0`

In general, the model used for generating rollouts at step `n` is from `ckpt[n - async_level]`.

- When async_level = 0, the rollout and gradient are based on the same model version.
  This is equivalent to synchronous on-policy training.
